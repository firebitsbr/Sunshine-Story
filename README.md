# Sunshine-Story
A Unity3D RPG created as my attempt at an Active-Time-Battle System, "Sunshine Story".

This repository contains the unity project file as a unity package, and the C# files used to make the game.

The game it self can be downloaded on GameJolt: http://gamejolt.com/games/rpg/sunshine-story/40812/
